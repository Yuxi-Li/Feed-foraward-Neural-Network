Feed-foraward-Neural-Network(FNN) 

      Language: C language
      Objective     * Realize the characteristics of FNN (Forward Propagation, 
                      Backward Propagation)
                    * Should have the ability to predict next step by using current input.
                    * Test FNN with training data (2 dimension, the shape is a circle) 
      How to use this program:
                    * Get training data: 
                      In the main program(last part of the program), change the path of the training data file(.txt)
                    * Run the program and give value for parameters of FNN.
if ((fp=fopen("G:\\training data.txt","r"))==NULL)      //read training data
	{
		printf("cannot open the file\n");
		
		
                    * Run the program and give value for parameters of FNN.
